            <p>
              Verble stores some game data locally in your browser and some operational game data on our servers.
              This can include in-progress puzzle state, guesses, completion status, and related records needed to run
              the games and show your current progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              We store puzzle content, scheduling data, player identifiers, and basic operational records in
              Supabase-backed systems and related infrastructure. Our service providers may also process standard
              technical logs such as IP address, browser details, device information, and request metadata for
              security, reliability, and abuse prevention.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not sell personal data. If we materially change what personal data we collect or how we use it, we
              will update this policy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline pt-2 text-xl font-bold text-[#2c2f31]">Cookies And Local Storage</h2>
            <p>
              Verble uses browser storage and cookies to keep the games working. This may include local storage for
              active game sessions and completion state, a persistent player identifier cookie, and limited access
              cookies used for features like archive unlocking.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline pt-2 text-xl font-bold text-[#2c2f31]">Accounts And Authentication</h2>
            <p>
              Some account, sign-in, or cross-device features may be available now or expanded over time. When you use
              those features, we may process account identifiers, authentication state, and related records needed to
              provide access and keep your account secure.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline pt-2 text-xl font-bold text-[#2c2f31]">Usage Analytics</h2>
            <p>
              Verble records limited first-party usage events, such as opening or completing a game, using account
              features, enabling reminders, or sharing a result. These records may include a player or account
              identifier, session identifier, game and puzzle date, page path, broad device category, referral domain,
              and campaign tags. We use this information to understand engagement, improve the games, diagnose problems,
              and prevent abuse. We do not include puzzle guesses, email addresses, or shared-result text in these
              analytics events.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-headline pt-2 text-xl font-bold text-[#2c2f31]">Third-Party Sign-In Data</h2>
            <p>
              If you sign in with Google or Apple, Verble uses that sign-in only to create or access your
              Verble account. Depending on the provider and your settings, we may receive your provider account
              identifier, email address, name, profile image, or Apple private relay email address.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
              <li>
                We use sign-in data to verify your identity, keep you signed in, secure your account, and connect your
                game progress, completions, streaks, and stats to your Verble account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Account and authentication records are stored in our Supabase-backed authentication and database
                systems. We do not sell Google or Apple sign-in data or share it with third parties for advertising.
              </li>
              <li>
                Verble does not request access to Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google contacts, iCloud,
                Apple contacts, photos, or other Google or Apple account content.
              </li>

            <h2 className="font-headline pt-2 text-xl font-bold text-[#2c2f31]">Game And Editorial Content</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
              <li>Games may use curated puzzle records, scheduling data, and editorial context to power gameplay and results.</li>
              <li>Some games may display images, descriptions, or other reference material as part of the play experience.</li>

            <p>
              You can clear local game data at any time by clearing site storage in your browser. If you have privacy
              questions, account deletion requests, or requests about sign-in data associated with your account, contact
              {legalContactEmail}. You can also manage or revoke Google or Apple account access from your Google or
